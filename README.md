# 1-25 


# This repository contains a simple Python implementation of a number-guessing game. The program generates a random integer between 1 and 25, and invites users to guess the number through a series of prompts. Users enter their guesses, and the program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. The game continues until the user successfully guesses the number.
